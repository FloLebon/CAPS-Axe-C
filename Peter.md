Platform robotique :  Within the motion capture room at Marey we have two state of the art humanoid robots.  These robots can be used as experimental stimuli in the investigation of human motor control and plasticity.  Several projects are currently underway:
1.  Robotself – plasticity of peripersonal space.  Responsible – Jocelyne Ventre-Dominey
Humans are teleported into the iCub humanoid, seeing through its eyes, as their robotic arm reaches in peripersonal space, in order to study the plasticity of the representation of peripersonal space.
2.  Spatio-temporal sequence learning.  Readaptic/Bioserenity.  Humans sit face-to-face with the Peppe humanoid and mimic its arm pointing sequences, in order to study how spatial and temporal structure contribute to sensorimotor learning.  Motion data recorded with Vicon.  EEG data recorded with Bioserenity Neuronaut.
3.  Preservation of social autonomy – memory assistant.  Robotonomie.  The robot stores photographs and narratives from human subjects, and then discovers common meaning in order to facilitate social interactions.  Uses deep language models.
Computational modeling:
1.  Reservoir computing for sensorimotor sequence learning:  a form of recurrent neural network which is used to simulate sensorimotor sequence learning as in 2 above.
2.  Language modeling
